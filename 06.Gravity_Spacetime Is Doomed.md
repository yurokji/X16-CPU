CHAPTER SIX

Gravity -Spacetime Is Doomed

“Einstein never ceased to ponder the meaning of the quantum theory. We often discussed his notions on objective reality. I recall that during one walk Einstein suddenly stopped, turned to me and asked whether I really believed that the moon exists only when I look at it.”

—CIPHER , THE MATRIX

If our senses were shaped by natural selection, then the FBT Theorem tells us we don’t see reality as it is. ITP tells us that our perceptions constitute an interface, specific to our species. It hides reality and helps us raise kids. Spacetime is the desktop of this interface and physical objects are among its icons.

ITP makes bold and testable predictions. It predicts that spoons and stars—all objects in space and time—do not exist when unperceived or unobserved. Something exists when I see a spoon, and that something, whatever it is, triggers my perceptual system to create a spoon and to endow it with a position, a shape, a motion, and other physical properties. But when I look away, I no longer create that spoon and it ceases to exist, along with its physical properties.

ITP predicts, for instance, that a photon, when unobserved, has no definite value of polarization. It predicts that an electron, when unobserved, has no definite value of spin, position, or momentum. An experiment that contradicted these predictions would disconfirm ITP.

The objects I see are my icons. The objects you see are your icons. When we compare notes, we find that our icons often agree—I see a cat and so do you; I see a fire and so do you. We often agree because we interact with the same reality, whatever it might be, and we deploy similar interfaces with similar icons. But ITP predicts that we can disagree. I may see fire, and cook my dinner, where you see none and your dinner stays cold; I may see a cat alive, where you see it dead.

ITP predicts that spacetime does not exist unperceived. My spacetime is the desktop of my interface. Your spacetime is your desktop. Spacetimes vary from observer to observer, and some properties of spacetime need not always agree across observers. Reality, whatever it might be, escapes the confines of spacetime.

These are, as I said, bold predictions. But are they really testable? Can they be ruled out by modern physics? I might boldly predict that the moon turns into swiss cheese when no one looks if I knew that my prediction could never be tested. To say that an electron has no spin when it is unobserved may sound bold, but how could this claim be tested? Can we perform an experiment, a careful observation, that tells us what happens when no one observes? If this sounds impossible to you, then, as I mentioned in chapter four, you’re in good company, for it also seemed impossible to the brilliant physicist Wolfgang Pauli. Einstein worried whether quantum theory entails that “the moon only exists when I look at it.” Pauli replied, “One should no more rack one’s brain about the problem of whether something one cannot know anything about exists all the same, than about the ancient question of how many angels are able to sit on the point of a needle. But it seems to me that Einstein’s questions are ultimately always of this kind.” 1

Einstein believed that spacetime and objects exist and have definite properties whether or not they are observed. More precisely, he believed in local realism. Realism is the claim that physical objects have definite values of physical properties—such as position, momentum, spin, charge, and polarization—even when unobserved. Locality is the claim that physical objects cannot influence each other faster than the speed of light. Local realism asserts that both realism and locality are true. Einstein insisted, as he wrote in a letter to the physicist Max Born, that physics should adhere to “the requirement for the independent existence of the physical reality present in different parts of space.” 2 Einstein believed that quantum theory, which violates this requirement, must be an incomplete theory of reality. He noted, in his letter to Born, that “I still cannot find any fact anywhere which would make it appear likely that that requirement will have to be abandoned.” 3

That was true when Einstein wrote it in 1948. But in 1964, the physicist John Bell discovered a fact that would have stunned Einstein: there are experiments for which quantum theory predicts outcomes that contradict local realism. 4 Whether or not quantum theory is, as Einstein claimed, incomplete, it is incompatible with local realism. Bell’s experiments have now been performed in multiple variations, and the predictions of quantum theory have been confirmed each time. We now have excellent evidence that local realism is empirically false, even if quantum theory is false or incomplete. This means that realism is false, or locality is false, or both are false. There is no happy choice here for Einstein, or for our normal intuitions.

One experimental test of local realism, inspired by Bell and conducted at the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands, measured the spins of entangled electrons. 5 Electron spin is strange. Frisbees, tops, and ice skaters can spin slowly, quickly, or anywhere in between. Not an electron. If you measure its spin along any axis, you find that there are just two possible answers—up or down. It’s as though the electron can spin either clockwise or counterclockwise, but at only one speed.

Entanglement is also strange. Place two spinning tops side by side, and you can describe each top and its spin separately. But you can’t do that for two entangled electrons. They have to be described as though they were one indivisible object, no matter how distant they are from each other. For instance, a physicist can entangle the spins of two electrons so that if the spin of one electron along some axis is up, then the spin of the other electron along that axis is always down. This holds no matter which axis you choose to measure. It also holds no matter how far apart the electrons are. They could be a billion light-years apart. Still, if you measure the spin of the electron near you, then you instantly know what you would find if you measured the spin of the other electron a billion light-years away. If realism is true, and if your measurement of spin here instantly affects the spin of an electron a billion light-years away, then this effect violates the claim of locality—that no influence can propagate faster than the speed of light.

In the Delft experiment, two electrons separated by 1,280 meters had their spins entangled. 6 It takes light just over four millionths of a second to travel this distance. The spins of the two electrons were measured along randomly chosen axes. Critically, the two spins were measured at the same time. This assured that one measurement could not affect the other by any local process—that is, by a process that propagates no faster than the speed of light. The Delft experiment, like all the others, confirmed the predictions of quantum theory and rejected local realism. The spin measurements of the two electrons were correlated in a way that Bell showed would be impossible if local realism were true. Either realism is false, and the electrons had no definite values of spin before they were measured, or locality is false, and the electrons influenced each other at speeds faster than light. Or realism and locality are both false.

Physicists are trying to discern which assumption is false, realism or locality. Experiments with entangled photons by Anton Zeilinger and his collaborators have ruled out a large class of theories that claim that realism is true and locality is false. 7 They conclude, “We believe that our results lend strong support to the view that any future extension of quantum theory that is in agreement with experiments must abandon certain features of realistic descriptions.” 8 Although the jury is still out, defending realism has gotten harder, thanks to the experiments of Zeilinger.

ITP predicts that realism is false, and physics does not contradict this prediction. Instead, each test of local realism, in defiance of our intuitions, confirms the prediction of ITP. Experiments such as Zeilinger’s are tightening the noose around the neck of realism.

So is another theorem that follows from quantum theory and makes no assumption about locality. It was proven by Bell, in 1966, and by Simon Kochen and Ernst Specker, in 1967, and is called the Kochen-Specker (KS) Theorem. It says that no property, such as position or spin, has a definite value that is independent of how it is measured. 9 The opposite claim, that a property can have a definite value that is independent of how it is measured, is called “noncontextual realism.” The KS Theorem says that noncontextual realism is false.
But noncontextual realism is precisely what we espouse in saying the moon is there when no one looks. It’s the realism that Francis Crick had in mind when he wrote that the sun and neurons exist when no one looks. It is this realism that is false—independent of any issues about locality.

The KS Theorem shatters another belief that Einstein had about reality. In 1935, in a famous paper with Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen, he claimed that “If, without in any way disturbing a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e., with probability equal to unity) the value of a physical quantity, then there exists an element of reality corresponding to that quantity.” 10

This claim may seem plausible. Suppose you can tell me with total confidence, before you make a measurement, that the spin of an electron along some axis will certainly be observed to be up—there’s no chance, you assure me, that it will be down. And suppose you’re right every time, for thousands of observations. Then I may conclude that your confidence is warranted, and your prediction is always right, because the electron really had that spin all along.

But I would be wrong. The physicists Adán Cabello, José M. Estebaranz, and Guillermo García-Alcaine constructed a clever case of the KS Theorem. In their example, quantum theory predicts the measured value of a physical quantity with certainty, “with probability equal to unity.” But they prove that the value cannot exist independent of the measurement. 11 This means I can be certain what value I’ll find, and yet that value is not an element of objective reality. Certainty about what you’ll see doesn’t imply it already exists. Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen were simply wrong to claim otherwise.

Most of us believe deeply in a physical reality, consisting of objects in spacetime that existed prior to life and observers; no observer is needed, we believe, to endow any object with a position, spin, or any other physical property. But as the implications of quantum theory are better understood and tested by experiments, this belief can survive only by clinging to possible gaps in the experiments, and those gaps are closing. An experiment at Fermilab, for instance, reveals that neutrinos—subatomic particles with almost no mass—have no value of the physical property of lepton flavor until they are observed. 12

Some physicists conclude that quantum theory counsels a profoundly new view of the world. As the physicist Carlo Rovelli puts it, “My effort here is not to modify quantum mechanics to make it consistent with my view of the world, but to modify my view of the world to make it consistent with quantum mechanics.” 13 The way that Rovelli updates his worldview is to reject “the notion of an absolute, or observer-independent, state of a system; equivalently, the notion of observer-independent values of physical quantities.” 14 Rovelli abandons noncontextual realism.

He explains why: “If different observers give different accounts of the same sequence of events, then each quantum mechanical description has to be understood as relative to a particular observer. Thus, a quantum mechanical description of a certain system cannot be taken as an ‘absolute’ (observer-independent) description of reality, but rather as a formalization, or codification, of properties of a system relative to a given observer. In quantum mechanics, ‘state’ as well as ‘value of a variable’—or ‘outcome of a measurement’—are relational notions.” 15

The physicist Chris Fields discards noncontextual realism on different grounds. He shows that if no observer sees all of reality at once, and if observing takes energy, then noncontextual realism must be false. 16 The physicists Chris Fuchs, David Mermin, and Rüdiger Schack claim that quantum theory entails “that reality differs from one agent to another. This is not as strange as it may sound. What is real for an agent rests entirely on what that agent experiences, and different agents have different experiences.” 17 They explain, “A measurement does not, as the term unfortunately suggests, reveal a pre-existing state of affairs. It is an action on the world by an agent that results in the creation of an outcome — a new experience for that agent. ‘Intervention’ might be a better term.” 18

On Fuchs’s interpretation of quantum theory, known as Quantum Bayesianism (or QBism), quantum states describe not the objective world but the beliefs of agents about consequences of their actions. Different agents may entertain different beliefs. No quantum state is universally true. Each is personal. My quantum state describes, as Chris Fuchs puts it, “ ‘The consequences (for me ) of my actions upon the physical system!’ It’s all ‘I-I-me-me mine,’ as the Beatles sang.” 19

This agrees with the interface theory of perception. My perceptions of spacetime and objects are an interface, shaped by natural selection not to reveal reality but to guide my actions in ways that enhance my fitness. My fitness. What benefits me may harm another. A bar of chocolate that boosts my health could kill my cat. Natural selection shapes perceptions in a personal fashion, to tell me the consequences for me of my actions upon the world. There is a world that exists even if I don’t look: solipsism is false. But my perceptions, like observations in quantum theory, don’t disclose that world. They counsel me—imperfectly, but well enough—how to act to be fit.

Quantum theory and evolutionary biology, so interpreted, together weave a remarkably consistent story. Quantum theory explains that measurements reveal no objective truths, just consequences for agents of their actions. Evolution tells us why—natural selection shapes the senses to reveal fitness consequences for agents of their actions. We are surprised that measurement and perception are so personal. We expected them to report objective and impersonal truths, albeit fallibly and in part. But when two pillars of science side with each other, and against our intuition, it’s time to reconsider our intuition.

This confluence of physics and evolution has not been obvious. In 1987, William Bartley described a conference in which the physicist John Wheeler presented his take on quantum theory. Sir Karl Popper, a famous philosopher of science, “turned to him and quietly said: ‘What you say is contradicted by biology.’ It was a dramatic moment And then the biologists broke into delighted applause. It was as if someone had finally said what they had been thinking.” 20

Bartley tells us what the biologists were thinking: “Sense perceptions or sensations are themselves only more or less accurate symbolic representations of external reality formed through the interaction between that external reality and organs of sense. One sees external reality, more or less accurately.” 21 This belief is no surprise. Evolutionary biology, as we have discussed, assumes the objective reality of objects such as DNA and organisms. It is not obvious that the acid of universal Darwinism—in the form of the FBT Theorem—dissolves this extraneous assumption and reveals that “more or less accurate symbolic representations of external reality” are never more fit than representations that hide external reality and encode fitness payoffs.

What did Wheeler propose that vexed the biologists? Wheeler claimed that, “What we call ‘reality,’ consists of an elaborate papier-mâché construction of imagination and theory filled in between a few iron posts of observation.” 22 We don’t, according to Wheeler, passively observe a preexisting objective reality, we actively participate in constructing reality by our acts of observation.

“Quantum mechanics evidences that there is no such thing as a mere ‘observer (or register) of reality.’ The observing equipment, the registering device, ‘participates in the defining of reality.’ In this sense the universe does not sit ‘out there.’ ” 23

Wheeler illustrated this with his delayed-choice experiment, a variation of the famous double-slit experiment first conducted by the physicists Clinton Davisson and Lester Germer in 1927. 24 Recall that in the double-slit experiment a photon gun shoots one photon at a time toward a photographic plate that records where each photon lands. But between the gun and the plate is a metal screen with two tiny slits in it—call them A and B— through which the photons can pass.

If just one slit is open, then the photons land, as expected, on a portion of the photographic plate just behind that slit. But if both slits are open, then the photons land, contrary to expectations, in a sequence of bands reminiscent of the interference patterns one gets when two water waves collide—with the remarkable consequence that some locations on the plate that get lots of photons when just one slit is open, will get fewer photons, or even none, when both slits are open. In this case it appears, at first glance, that each photon somehow went through both A and B at the same time. That is no problem for a wave. But a photon is a particle; and if we do this same experiment with electrons, which are also particles, we get the same interference pattern.

So how does a particle do this trick? Does it split itself in half? If we try to observe the slits closely, we always see a photon go through just one slit, never both. Moreover, if we observe which slit it goes through then the interference pattern disappears.

No one really knows what a photon or electron does when both slits are open. This is an unsolved mystery of quantum theory. It seems incorrect to say it goes through A , through B , through both, or through neither. Physicists just say that its path is a superposition of A and B. This just means we don’t know what’s happening, even though we can write down simple formulas, involving linear combinations called superpositions, that accurately model the results of experiments. And it’s not just tiny particles, like photons and electrons, that do this magic with double-slits. In 2013, Sandra Eibenberger and her collaborators found the same magic feat performed by a large molecule—fondly called C284.H190.F320.N4.S12—consisting of 810 atoms, and weighing more than 10,000 protons or 18 million electrons. It is a tad smaller than a virus. 25 Quantum weirdness is not confined to the subatomic realm.

Wheeler’s delayed-choice variation on this experiment is clever: wait until after the photon passes the metal screen, and only then decide what to measure—path A , path B , or a superposition. In his words, “Let us wait until the quantum has already gone through the screen before we—at our free choice—decide whether it shall have gone ‘through both slits’ or ‘through one.’ ” 26 Wheeler’s experiment has been performed with photons (and helium atoms!) and it works. 27 What we choose to measure after the photon has passed the screen determines what the photon did, or at least what we can say about what it did, before we measured. “In the delayed-choice experiment we, by a decision in the here and now, have an irretrievable influence on what we will want to say about the past—a strange inversion of the normal order of time.” 28 The past depends on our choice in the present. No wonder that Popper and the biologists were nonplussed.

Wheeler later expanded his experiment to cosmic scales. 29 Instead of a photon gun, consider a distant quasar—a supermassive black hole that sucks material from a surrounding galaxy into its accretion disk and, in the process, emits an astronomical amount of light and radiation, perhaps one hundred times the entire output of our Milky Way galaxy. Suppose this quasar lies behind a massive galaxy. According to Einstein’s theory of gravity, such a galaxy bends spacetime. His theory also predicts that if everything lines up just right, we can see two images of that quasar, because its light can travel two different paths through the bent spacetime—a cosmic optical illusion caused by an enormous gravitational lens. Figure 8 shows an example in a photograph taken by the Hubble Space Telescope of the Twin Quasar QSO 0957+561, almost 14 billion light-years from earth.

With this, we have the setup needed for a delayed-choice experiment on a cosmic scale. Using a telescope to capture photons from the Twin Quasar, we can choose to measure which path through the gravitational lens a photon takes—the upper or lower path in the Hubble image—or we can choose to measure a superposition. If we choose to measure its path and we discover, say, that it’s on the upper path, then for almost 14 billion years that photon has been on that path because of a choice we made today. If we had chosen instead to measure a superposition, then that photon would have a different history for the last 14 billion years. Our choice today determines billions of years of history. Most of us can’t bench-press a hundred kilos. But we can reach back billions of years and trillions of kilometers to rewrite the past—a Herculean feat.

This raises the stakes. Quantum theory smashed our intuitions about objects, by denying that they have definite values of physical properties that are independent of whether, or how, they are observed. Now it smashes space and time. As Wheeler put it, “No space. No time. Heaven did not hand down the word ‘time’. Man invented it. If there are problems with the concept of time, they are of our own creation as Einstein put it ‘Time and space are modes by which we think, and not conditions in which we live.’ ” 30

Einstein showed that different observers, moving at different speeds, disagree in their measurements of time and distance. But they agree about the speed of light, and about intervals in spacetime—a union of space and time into a single entity in which space and time can trade off. This raised the hope that spacetime is an objective reality even if space and time, separately, are not. Wheeler, wielding his delayed-choice experiment as a weapon of commonsense destruction, leveled this hope. “What are we to say about that weld of space and time into spacetime which Einstein gave us in his 1915 and still standard classical geometrodynamics? no account of existence can ever hope to rate as fundamental which does not translate all of continuum physics into the language of bits.” 31 

He argued that spacetime and its objects are not fundamental. Instead he proposed the doctrine of “It from bit”: information, not matter, is fundamental; the “its” of matter arise from bits of information. Wheeler’s jump from spacetime to bits of information is more than a bit jarring. Why should the two be related? And why should bits replace spacetime? Spacetime seems so real—indeed the very bedrock and framework of reality. Surely spacetime existed before there were bits, and surely bits exist inside spacetime, not vice versa?

But once again our intuitions are wrong. An example reveals how wrong. Suppose I work for a computer manufacturer, and I have to design the memory for their next supercomputer. I want to cram the most memory into the least volume. The competition is stiff, so I want to get it right. I learn through the grapevine that my top competitor plans to cram its memory into six equal spheres, as shown in Figure 9 . I smile. They’ve made a silly mistake. Those six spheres pack neatly into a larger sphere with more volume—in fact, over twice the volume. That larger sphere should hold over twice the memory. The competition is wasting all that valuable space between its six spheres. I’ll use it to cram in more memory. I proudly tell the marketing department to get the ads ready—our computer has twice the memory of the competitor’s.

But I’m wrong. If I and my competitor cram as much memory as possible into our designs, mine ends up with less memory—about 3 percent less. Even though my big sphere has twice the volume of their six smaller spheres combined, even though it could contain all six smaller spheres inside it, still, it holds less memory. If this bothers you, then you understand the problem.

Jacob Bekenstein and Stephen Hawking showed that the amount of information you can cram into a region of space is proportional to the area of the surface surrounding that space. 32 That’s right, the area , not the volume. They first discovered this rule for black holes, but then realized it holds for any region of spacetime, not just regions containing a black hole. This rule is called the “holographic principle.”

Hawking figured out how many bits of information an area can contain. To understand his result, you must first know that spacetime, like the desktop of your computer, has pixels—the smallest patches of spacetime that are possible. Smaller than that, spacetime simply doesn’t exist. Each pixel of spacetime has the same length, called the Planck length. 33 It’s tiny—about as tiny compared to a proton as the United States is to the entire visible universe. Spacetime also has a smallest area, called the Planck area, which is the square of the Planck length. These are the tiniest pixels of spacetime area that are possible. And Hawking discovered it’s the number of these pixels in a surface, not the number of voxels in the volume inside, that dictates how many bits it can hold.

We all have strong convictions about space and time. Mine were stunned by the holographic principle. But I soon realized that this result fits well with ITP, which says that spacetime, as you perceive it, is like the desktop of an interface. If you look through a magnifying glass at the desktop of your computer, you’ll see millions of pixels—the smallest patches of the desktop that are possible. Smaller than that, the desktop simply doesn’t exist. Step back, and it looks like a continuous surface. If you play a video game on your computer, such as Doom or Uncharted , you see compelling 3D worlds with 3D objects. Yet the information is entirely 2D, limited by the number of pixels on the screen. The same is true when you look away from your computer to the world around you. It too has pixels, and all the information is 2D.

The physicists Leonard Susskind and Gerard 't Hooft helped to pioneer the holographic principle. Susskind says, “Here, then, is the conclusion that 't Hooft and I had reached: the three-dimensional world of ordinary experience—the universe filled with galaxies, stars, planets, houses, boulders, and people—is a hologram, an image of reality coded on a distant two-dimensional (2D) surface. This new law of physics, known as the holographic principle, asserts that everything inside a region of space can be described by bits of information restricted to the boundary.” 34 This principle is now widely embraced in theoretical physics. Observers have no access to “objects” in “space.” Observers only have access to information—bits—written on a boundary that surrounds space.

Black holes, which led to the holographic principle, have led another assault on our intuitions about spacetime. Hawking discovered that black holes radiate energy, now called Hawking radiation, whose temperature increases as the size of the black hole decreases. Hawking radiation takes energy out of a black hole, causing it to shrink and, eventually, evaporate altogether. Hawking claimed that, in this process, a black hole destroys all information about any objects that fall into it. 35 If a cat fell in, it would disappear into the black hole and all information about it would be forever annihilated.

That’s bad for the cat, but also for quantum theory, which assumes that information is never eradicated. This is no minor assumption. If you take it away, quantum theory unravels into nonsense. Hawking’s claim posed a serious threat.

Einstein’s theory of general relativity says that a black hole sucks in and devours not just objects, but even space itself. As space gets sucked closer to the black hole, it flows faster, eventually reaching, and then exceeding, the speed of light. Nothing can travel through space faster than the speed of light. But that speed limit does not apply to space itself. Where space pours into the black hole at the speed of light, it is no longer possible for light, or information, to paddle upstream fast enough to escape. This is the event horizon of the black hole, the divide between the outside, where light can escape, and the inside, where escape is not possible.
According to Einstein, a cat falling through the event horizon would, if the black hole is big enough, experience nothing unusual. Eventually, as the cat plunged toward the center of the black hole, it would be “spaghettified,” stretched beyond recognition by the rapidly changing force of gravity. But at the horizon it would just float on through, unaware that its fate was sealed.

According to Einstein, the cat and all its information coast across the event horizon never to be seen again. Then, when the black hole evaporates, so does all information about the cat.

Quantum theory says that information is never destroyed. General relativity says that it can cross an event horizon and be erased. This is a serious paradox.

It gets worse. Consider two cat lovers, Prudence and Folly. Prudence watches the cat at a safe distance from the black hole. She sees the cat approaching (but never passing) the event horizon, slowly stretching and deforming beyond recognition, and eventually getting barbecued by the Hawking radiation—a gruesome fate. Folly takes the plunge into the black hole with the cat. She sees something more pleasant—the cat passing safely through the horizon, with no contorting or torching. According to Prudence the cat and its information are mangled outside the horizon, but according to Folly the cat and its information are thriving inside the horizon.

But having the cat’s information in two places—inside and outside the black hole—violates another rule of quantum theory: quantum information can’t be copied. Not only is quantum information never destroyed, it can never be cloned. This is counterintuitive. I can copy information onto a hard drive. I can lose, or destroy, that drive. But my file consists of classical bits, which record classical information. Quantum information, however, is different from classical, and this raises the ante in the conflict between general relativity and quantum theory. 36

Can we resolve this conflict without violating key principles of these pillars of science? The physicist Leonard Susskind found a way, using a concept from quantum theory: complementarity. 37 In classical physics you can specify an object’s position and momentum at the same time. You can say that the instant after a soccer player kicks a ball its position on the field is this and its momentum toward the goal is that. But not in quantum physics. If you fire an electron out of an electron gun, you can precisely measure its position or its momentum, but not both at the same time. According to Heisenberg’s uncertainty principle, the more you know about position the less you can know about momentum, and vice versa. The Kochen-Specker (KS) Theorem tells us, as we discussed earlier, that the position and momentum of the electron in fact have no real values independent of the kind of measurement—position or momentum—that you perform.

Susskind took complementarity to a new level, which he called “Black Hole Complementarity.” 38 For the case of the cat, it says that the description of the cat inside the black hole is complementary to the description outside the black hole. You can observe a cat outside the horizon of the black hole being incinerated, or you can observe a flame-free cat inside the horizon. Both are legitimate, but complementary, descriptions. And here is the key point: no observer can see both descriptions of the cat, just as no observer can see the position and the momentum of an electron.

Susskind’s idea is now called “horizon complementarity” because it applies not just to the horizon of a black hole, but to any event horizon, including the horizon that bounds the visible universe.

Horizon complementarity seems radical, but it works. It allows quantum theory and general relativity to coexist without contradiction. But we must let go of thinking we can describe spacetime and objects outside the horizon and, at the same time, inside the horizon. The assumption that we can see both, the assumption of a god’s-eye view, which no observer can in fact take, is the problem. If we relinquish the divine view from nowhere, then quantum theory and general relativity can peacefully coexist. But the implications are stunning. One may dismiss the complementarity of an electron’s position and momentum as an odd feature of tiny things. But this dismissal won’t work for horizons of black holes. They can be millions of miles across. The vast spacetime inside a huge horizon is complementary to the vast spacetime outside. If we insist on a single objective spacetime that includes the inside and outside of a black hole—an idea embraced by Einstein and by common sense—then we put quantum theory and general relativity in conflict. If we let go of objective spacetime, then they enjoy a rapprochement.

Horizon complementarity challenges the idea that there is one objective spacetime that contains all observers. But physicists Joe Polchinski, Ahmed Almheiri, Donald Marolf, and James Sully (known by their last initials as AMPS) found another way to thrash this idea using quantum entanglement. 39 Again consider Folly and a black hole. But this time, let the black hole emit Hawking radiation until it shrinks to half its original size, at which point, quantum theory tells us, one can start to decode the information in the radiation.

According to quantum field theory, the vacuum is not just a big nothing. It is seething with pairs of virtual particles. Each member of an evanescent pair is entangled with its partner and has opposite properties. A pair appears and immediately their opposing properties annihilate each other, leaving a vacuum devoid of real particles. Now consider two such virtual particles, 1 and 2, that happen to appear right next to the horizon of the black hole and that, from Folly’s view before she takes the plunge, don’t obliterate each other. Instead, 2 falls into the black hole and 1 becomes, for her, a real particle of Hawking radiation.

Folly, before she jumps into the black hole, can measure that 1 is entangled with some particle, 3, in the Hawking radiation that emerged earlier from the black hole. She can then let herself slip into the black hole where she finds that 1 and 2 are entangled.
But this raises a problem: quantum theory requires entanglement to be monogamous. Particle 1 can be maximally correlated with particle 2 or particle 3, but not with both.

Horizon complementarity can’t solve the AMPS problem because this problem is not about two observers separated by a horizon. It’s about one observer, Folly, who sees 1 and 3 entangled and then sees 1 and 2 entangled. AMPS tried to solve the problem by proposing that there’s a firewall at the horizon that incinerates poor Folly as she passes through, so that she never sees 1 and 2 entangled. This firewall rescues quantum theory, but it violates general relativity, which predicts that nothing unusual should happen at the horizon—Folly should coast through with no problem, and certainly shouldn’t see a wall of fire suddenly appear from nothing.

The AMPS “firewall paradox” is causing consternation, and many efforts to resolve the paradox. Daniel Harlow and Patrick Hayden, for instance, discovered that it’s not easy to decipher the Hawking radiation. 40 Using the best quantum computing possible, it would take Folly too much time to figure out that 1 and 3 were entangled. The black hole would already fizzle to nothing, so that Folly could not also observe that 1 and 2 were entangled. No observer can measure both entanglements.

Some physicists counsel avoidance of a god’s-eye view by restricting physics to the “causal diamond” of an observer—the portion of spacetime that may interact with the observer.

For instance, the physicist Raphael Bousso proposes the principle of observer complementarity : “Each observer’s experiments admit a consistent description, but a simultaneous description of both observers is inconsistent. This implies a fascinating conclusion which I will call observer complementarity. Observer complementarity is the statement that a fundamental description of Nature need only describe experiments that are consistent with causality. Observer complementarity implies that there must be a theory for every causal diamond, but not necessarily for spacetime regions that are contained in no causal diamond.” 41

The physicist Tom Banks, in an interview with science writer Amanda Gefter, makes a similar claim. “Relativity tells us that no observers are special. There has to be a gauge equivalence between causal diamonds, so everything outside my horizon is a gauge copy of the physics I can observe right here. So if you think of every possible causal diamond, you have an infinitely redundant description of the same quantum system seen by different observers and spacetime emerges when you put all these descriptions together.” 42

This aligns with the claim of Fuchs, Mermin, and Schack, discussed earlier, “that reality differs from one agent to another. This is not as strange as it may sound. What is real for an agent rests entirely on what that agent experiences, and different agents have different experiences.” 43 Quantum states vary from observer to observer. So does spacetime itself.

Which raises a perplexing question: What about the big bang? Didn’t it happen 13 billion 799 million years ago, before any observers? Isn’t it a fact of objective reality, not merely an interface description of an observer? If ITP says that spacetime is a feature of my desktop, not an insight into reality, then it says the same about the big bang. Surely no physicist would agree?

At least one physicist has argued that the universe has no history apart from observers, that “histories of the universe depend on what is being observed, contrary to the usual idea that the universe has a unique, observer independent history.” 44 That physicist was Stephen Hawking who, in collaboration with the physicist Thomas Hertog, favored a “top-down” cosmology that starts with the observer, rather than a “bottom-up” cosmology that assumes a god’s-eye view.

They explain that “In our past there is an epoch of the early universe when quantum gravity was important. The remnants of this early phase are all around us. The central problem in cosmology is to understand why these remnants are what they are, and how the distinctive features of our universe emerged from the big bang.” 45 Their point is that the colossal energy and density of a nascent universe demand a quantum mechanical description, with superpositions of states. The classical premise of a unique primeval state for the universe is inapt: “if one does adopt a bottom-up approach to cosmology, one is immediately led to an essentially classical framework, in which one loses all ability to explain cosmology’s central question—why our universe is the way it is.” 46

So, although the move is radical, they abandon the bottom-up framework. “The framework we propose is thus more like a top-down approach to cosmology, where the histories of the universe depend on the precise question asked.” 47 Measurements we make today—say, of the density of energy of the vacuum or of the rate of expansion of the universe—constrain the histories of the universe that we can entertain.
Hawking’s cosmology concurs with Wheeler’s experiment, discussed earlier, in which the billion-year history I ascribe to a photon from an ancient quasar depends on what I measure today. If I measure which path around a gravitational lens it took, then I am entitled to ascribe a billion-year history in which it went, say, through the top path. But I am not so entitled if, instead, I measure an interference pattern. Wheeler put it well. “Each elementary quantum phenomenon is an elementary act of ‘fact creation.’ That is incontestable. But is that the only mechanism needed to create all that is? Is what took place at the big bang the consequence of billions upon billions of these elementary processes, these elementary ‘acts of observer-participancy,’ these quantum phenomena? Have we had the mechanism of creation before our eyes all this time without recognizing the truth?” 48

Hawking’s approach coheres with the cosmology of QBism, in which quantum states are beliefs of observers, not scoops on reality. What I see now informs the states I assign to the past, including the big bang. As Fuchs says, “Noting how the Big Bang itself is a moment of creation with some resemblance to every individual quantum measurement, one starts to wonder whether even it ‘might be on the inside.’ Certainly QBism has creation going on all the time and everywhere; quantum measurement is just about an agent hitching a ride and partaking in that ubiquitous process.” 49

This chapter began with the prediction of ITP that spacetime and objects do not exist unperceived; they are not fundamental reality. I asked whether this prediction has been ruled out by physics in its quest for a theory of everything (TOE). We have a clear answer: it has not. Instead, it has remarkable support.

The brief tour of physics in this chapter is, to be sure, far from exhaustive. It omits interpretations of quantum theory—by Bohm, Everett, and others—that try to bestow reality on objects and spacetime. 50 My goal, however, was not a synopsis of physics, which would require a tome, but a brief on physics that shows ITP is not proscribed.

Remarkably, a key prediction of ITP—that spacetime must go before a TOE will come—is close to consensus among physicists. Nima Arkani-Hamed, for instance, in a 2014 lecture at the Perimeter Institute, mentions that “Almost all of us believe that spacetime doesn’t exist, that spacetime is doomed, and has to be replaced by some more primitive building blocks.” 51

If spacetime is doomed, then so are its physical objects. They must be superceded by more primitive building blocks. But if spacetime is not the bedrock of reality, not the preexisting stage for the drama of life, then what is it? It is, I will suggest, a data-compressing and error-correcting code for fitness.
