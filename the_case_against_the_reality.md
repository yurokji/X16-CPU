PREFACE
Your eyes will save your life today. With their guidance, you will not
tumble down stairs, leap before a speeding Maserati, grab the tail of a
rattlesnake, or munch on a moldy apple.
Why are our eyes, and all of our senses, reliable guides? Most of us have a
hunch: they tell us the truth. The real world, we assume, consists of cars and
stairs and other objects in space and time. They exist even if no living
creature observes them. Our senses are simply a window on this objective
reality. Our senses do not, we assume, show us the whole truth of objective
reality. Some objects are too small or too far away. On rare occasions our
senses are even wrong—artists, psychologists, cinematographers, and others
can cook up illusions that fool them. But normally our senses report the truths
we need to navigate safely through life.
Why do our senses exist to reveal the truth? Again, we have a hunch:
evolution. Those of our ancestors who saw reality more accurately had an
advantage over those who saw it less accurately, especially in critical
activities such as feeding, fighting, fleeing, and mating. As a result, they were
more likely to pass on their genes, which coded for more accurate
perceptions. We are the offspring of those who, in each generation, saw
objective reality more accurately. Therefore, we can be confident that we see
it accurately. Our hunch, in short, is that truer perceptions are fitter
perceptions. Evolution weeds out untrue perceptions. That is why our
perceptions are windows on objective reality.
These hunches are wrong. On the contrary, our perceptions of snakes and
apples, and even of space and time, do not reveal objective reality. The
problem is not that our perceptions are wrong about this or that detail. It’s
that the very language of objects in space and time is simply the wrong
language to describe objective reality. This is not a hunch. It is a theorem of
evolution by natural selection that wallops our hunches.
