CHAPTER SEVEN

Virtuality

Inflating a Holoworld

“Many, many separate arguments, all very strong individually, suggest that the very notion of spacetime is not a fundamental one. Spacetime is doomed. There is no such thing as spacetime fundamentally in the actual underlying description of the laws of physics. That’s very startling, because what physics is supposed to be about is describing things as they happen in space and time. So, if there’s no spacetime, it’s not clear what physics is about.”

“There is no spoon.”
—SPOON BOY , THE MATRIX

Science can demystify the exotic. This talent leads to new technology—from cell phones to satellites—which can seem, in the words of Arthur C. Clarke, “indistinguishable from magic.”

Science can also mystify the mundane. It can plunge us without warning down a rabbit hole of the curious and curiouser. For instance, I see a spoon sitting now on the table over there. This is so comonplace that I’m not tempted to give it a moment’s thought. But here, where I don’t expect it, science injects a profound mystery: we still don’t understand “now” and “there.” That is, we don’t understand time and space—length, width, and depth—which we take for granted, which are woven into the very fabric of our daily perceptions, and which we assume are a true and reliable guide to physical reality.

What we do understand, many physicists now tell us, is that spacetime is doomed. Space and time figure centrally in our daily perceptions. But even their sophisticated union into spacetime, forged by Einstein, cannot be part of a true description of the fundamental laws of nature. Spacetime, and all the objects it contains, will disappear in that true description. Nobel Laureate David Gross, for instance, observed, “Everyone in string theory is convinced . . . that spacetime is doomed. But we don’t know what it’s replaced by.” 1 Fields medalist Edward Witten has also suggested that spacetime may be “doomed.” 2 Nathan Seiberg of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton said, “I am almost certain that space and time are illusions. These are primitive notions that will be replaced by something more sophisticated.” 3

This is deeply unsettling. As Nima Arkani-Hamed explained, in the chapter’s opening quote, “What physics is supposed to be about is describing things as they happen in space and time. So, if there’s no spacetime, it’s not clear what physics is about.” For physicists this is wonderful news. To recognize a failure of a theory, no matter how dear that theory may be, is progress. Replacing the theory of spacetime with something more fundamental is an exciting challenge for creative theorists, and has the potential to transform our vision of the world—perhaps telling us, for the first time, what physics is really about.

My goal in this chapter is a tad less ambitious. The news that spacetime is doomed—and objects with it—does not yet inform current theories of visual perception. Instead, these theories typically assume that objects in space and time are fundamental in physical reality, and that visual perception normally recovers true properties of these preexisting objects. Current theories of perception often disagree about which true properties are reported, and about how the reports are generated, but they all assume to be true what physicists have discovered to be false—that objects in spacetime are fundamental.

I will briefly discuss the standard theories of perception, and then propose a new slant on our perception of spacetime and objects.

The new perspective is motivated by ITP and the holographic principle—the momentous discovery, discussed in chapter six, that the amount of data you can store in a region of space depends on the area surrounding that region, not on its volume. This new outlook on spacetime and objects flows from the idea that our perceptions have evolved to encode fitness payoffs, and to guide adaptive behavior. 4 Somehow, spacetime and objects do just that. But how? I propose that they do it, in part, by data compression and error correction of fitness information.

First, let’s look at data compression. A fitness-payoff function can be complex, and many fitness-payoff functions are typically relevant to my survival, so the amount of information about fitness that’s pertinent to me could be enormous—overwhelming if I had to see it all. I need it compressed to a size I can manage.

Suppose you want to email a vacation photo to a friend, but the image is too large for your server. You compress the image and check that it still looks good. If it doesn’t, if you can’t see that it’s your family posing by the Grand Canyon, then you compress it less. You look for a happy tradeoff—compressed enough to send, but not so compressed that it’s not worth sending.

Spacetime and objects are, for human vision, that happy tradeoff. Fitness-payoff functions can vary in hundreds of dimensions. Human vision, shaped by eons of natural selection, compresses them into three dimensions of space and one dimension of time, and into objects with shapes and colors. I can’t handle hundreds of dimensions, but I can handle a few. This compression no doubt omits some information about fitness. I don’t, for instance, see the millions of muons that streak through my body each day, damaging it with ionizing radiation. But I do see enough information about fitness to survive and raise offspring.

We see objects in three dimensions not because we reconstruct objective reality, but because this is the format of a compression algorithm that evolution happened to build into us. Other species may have other data formats for representing fitness. We live and move and have our being not in an objective reality of spacetime and objects, but in a data structure with a format of spacetime and objects, which happened to evolve in Homo sapiens to represent fitness payoffs in a manner that is frugal and useful. Our perceptions are encoded in this data structure, but we mistakenly believe that its spacetime format is the objective reality in which we live.

This mistake is understandable and even excusable: our data format constrains not just how we see, but how we think. It’s not easy to step outside its confines, or even to recognize that this may be possible. Waking up to this possibility has a long pedigree in intellectual and religious culture.

There is much to explore about spacetime and objects as compressed encodings of fitness payoffs. For instance, what aspect of fitness is captured by space, and what by objects? How do shapes, colors, textures, and motions arise in the compression of fitness? Why does the compression of fitness lead us to have perceptions that are formatted in different modalities—vision, hearing, taste, smell, and touch? Perhaps distances in space encode costs of acquiring resources: an apple that costs few calories to acquire may appear just a meter away, while an apple that costs far more calories may appear much further away. A predator may appear more distant the more calories it must expend to get me. Recent experiments support this idea. For instance, Dennis Proffitt and his collaborators found that people given a drink containing glucose make shorter estimates of distance than those given a drink containing no carbohydrates (and, instead, an artificial sweetener); people who are more aerobically fit make shorter estimates of distance than those who are less fit. This suggests that our perception of a distance depends not just on the energy cost, but rather on the ratio of the energy cost to our available energy. 5

Let’s turn to error correction for a moment. When we bank or buy online, valuable data shoots across the internet. To prevent its theft by hackers, we encrypt it. But another problem is just as important: noise. Suppose you spend sixty dollars to buy flowers online for mom. Later you learn that noise on the net slipped two decimals, and you in fact spent six thousand dollars—an expensive mistake. If such mistakes were common, commerce online would halt. To prevent them, data are formatted in an error-correcting code before being sent.

A key to detecting and correcting errors is redundancy. 6 A simple example is repetition. Suppose that you want to send four bits of data, such as the bit string 1101. You could send it three times in succession: 1101 1101 1101. The receiver checks that all three transmissions agree. If so, then she concludes that there is no error. But if one transmission differs from the others, then she detects an error. She can ask for another transmission, or assume that the two strings that agree are correct.

There are many clever ways to add redundancy, such as embedding messages into higher-dimensional spaces. But the key point is that our senses convey messages about fitness payoffs, and getting the right message is critical to survival. Slip a decimal about fitness and you may slip from life to death. We should expect that natural selection has built redundancy into our perceptual interface, that it has shaped our desktop of spacetime and our icons of physical objects to be redundant codes for fitness payoffs that permit detection and correction of errors.

This is exactly what Bekenstein and Hawking discovered about spacetime. It is redundant. Two dimensions contain all the information in any 3D space. This is the well-established holographic principle of Susskind and 't Hooft that we discussed in the last chapter. It is counterintuitive, and belies our assumption that 3D space is an objective reality that our senses reconstruct. But it makes sense if you assume that our senses report fitness and need redundancy—such as an extra dimension of space—to ensure that their reports aren’t crippled by noise.

Physicists have confirmed the prediction of natural selection that space is redundant. But have they also confirmed that in fact this redundancy of space underwrites an error-correcting code? That effort is under way and looks promising. The physicists Ahmed Almheiri, Xi Dong, and Daniel Harlow find that the redundancy of space revealed by the holographic principle reflects properties of an error-correcting code that protects against erasure of data by noise. 7 As they put it, “The holographic principle also naturally arises in the guise of the general statement that there is an upper bound on how much quantum information a given code can protect from erasures.” 8 The physicists John Preskill, Daniel Harlow, Fernando Pastawski, and others have discovered specific ways that the geometry of spacetime can be interpreted as a quantum error-correcting code. 9

The picture that emerges is that spacetime and objects are a code used by our senses to report fitness. Like any decent code, it uses redundancy to counter noise. This picture is precisely ITP, with the extra insight that the interface compresses data and resists noise.

This picture is not endorsed by most vision scientists. Instead, they assume that vision is veridical, that it reconstructs real objects in spacetime. This assumption is spelled out in the Encyclopaedia Britannica entry on “space perception” by Louis Jolyon West, former psychiatrist in chief at the UCLA Hospital and Clinics. West tells us in his entry that veridical perception is “the direct perception of stimuli as they exist. Without some degree of veridicality concerning physical space, one cannot seek food, flee from enemies, or even socialize. Veridical perception also causes a person to experience changing stimuli as if they were stable: even though the sensory image of an approaching tiger grows larger, for example, one tends to perceive that the animal’s size remains unchanged.”

Vision scientists don’t claim, of course, that perception is always veridical. They admit that it can distort reality by using heuristics. But they assume that veridicality is the goal, and is normally attained.

They argue, for instance, that symmetries in our perceptions of objects reveal symmetries in objective reality. The vision scientist Zygmunt Pizlo spells this out. “Consider the shapes of animal bodies. Most, if not all of them, are mirror-symmetrical. How do we know that they are mirror-symmetrical? Because we see them as such. Seeing a mirror-symmetrical object as mirror-symmetrical is not possible unless the two symmetrical halves are perceived as having identical shapes. Now, note that this is remarkable because: (1) we only see the front, visible surfaces of each of the two halves, and (2) we see the two halves from viewing directions that are 180° apart. Unless shape constancy is a real phenomenon and unless it is close to perfect, we would not even know that symmetrical shapes actually exist.” 10

We can recast this as a precise claim: any symmetry in our perceptions entails a corresponding symmetry in objective reality.
Is this claim true? Here we don’t need hunches, we need a theorem. And we have one. The “Invention of Symmetry Theorem,” which I conjectured and Chetan Prakash proved, reveals that the claim is false. 11 This theorem states that symmetries in our perceptions entail nothing about the structure of objective reality. The proof is constructive. It shows precisely how perceptions and actions can enjoy a symmetry—such as translation, rotation, mirror, and Lorentz—in a world that lacks any symmetry.

This raises an obvious question. We see many objects with symmetries. Why? If symmetries in perception don’t reveal symmetries of reality, then why should we see symmetry at all?

The answer, once again, is data compression and error correction—their algorithms and data structures often involve symmetries. 12 A surfeit of fitness information can be compressed to a feasible level using symmetries. To get a feel for this, consider looking at an apple. How will it look if you move a little to the left? You can answer this using symmetry—a simple rotation and translation. Rather than store millions of numbers per view, you need just five—three for translation and two for rotation. Symmetries are simple programs that we use to compress data and correct errors. The symmetries in our perceptions reveal how we compress and encode information, not the nature of objective reality.

“But,” you might object, “we can build computer vision systems that drive cars and see the same shapes and symmetries that we do. Doesn’t this demonstrate that we, and the computers, are seeing reality as it is?”

Not at all. The Invention of Symmetry Theorem applies to any perceptual system, whether biological or machine. The symmetries a computer sees entail nothing about the structure of objective reality. We can build a robot that sees the symmetries we see. But this grants us no insight into the structure of the world.

Pizlo offers an evolutionary rationale for veridical perceptions of objects and space. “It is not possible to conceive the successful evolution of animals, and the success of their natural selection without providing for planning and purposive behavior.” 13 He argues that our success in hunting, planting, and harvesting depends on planning and coordination, which require veridical perception of objective reality.

Planning and coordination are critical to our success. But do they require a veridical representation of objective reality? No, according to the FBT Theorem. Indeed, online games such as Grand Theft Auto let players collaborate toward ignoble goals, such as robbing stores or stealing cars. Their plans are informed not by veridical perceptions of transistors and network protocols, but by a fake world of fast cars and tempting targets.

The arguments for veridical perception fail. But it is still the standard theory in vision science. According to this theory, there really are 3D objects in spacetime with objective properties—such as shape —that exist even when no one looks. When you look at an apple, light bouncing off its surface gets focused by the optics of your eye onto your 2D retina. This optical projection of the apple onto your 2D retina loses information about the apple’s 3D shape and depth. So your visual system analyzes its 2D information and figures out the apple’s true 3D shape. It recovers, or reconstructs, the information lost by the optical projection. Sometimes this recovery process is called “inverse optics,” and sometimes “Bayesian estimation.” 14

Proponents of “embodied cognition,” building on the ideas of the psychologist James Gibson, push back on this story. 15 They say that we are physical beings with real bodies that interact with the real physical world, and that our perceptions are intimately linked with our actions. Perception and bodily action must be understood together. When I see a red apple, I am not simply solving an abstract problem of inverse optics or Bayesian estimation, I see a 3D shape that is tightly coupled to my actions—how I move toward it, grasp it, and eat it. Most vision scientists who subscribe to inverse optics or Bayesian estimation agree that action and perception are intimately linked.

Proponents of “radical embodied cognition” claim not just that perception and action are linked, but also that perception requires no processing of information. 16 The interplay of perception and action can be understood, they claim, without invoking computations and representations. This radical view has few devotees and is at odds with the claim of quantum physicists that all physical processes are information processes, and that no information is ever destroyed. It is also at odds with the truism that any system that undergoes a sequence of state transitions can be interpreted as a computer (perhaps a dumb one, but a computer nonetheless).

ITP disagrees with the claim of standard and embodied theories that perception is veridical, but it agrees that perception and action are closely linked. Our perceptions evolved to guide adaptive exploration and action: my icon of an apple guides my choice of whether to eat, as well as the grasping and biting actions by which I eat; my icon of poison ivy guides my choice not to eat, as well as the steps I take to avoid any contact.

ITP makes a counterintuitive claim about causality: the appearance of causal interactions between physical objects in spacetime is a fiction—a useful fiction, but a fiction nonetheless. I see a cue ball hit an eight ball into a corner pocket. I assume, naturally, that the cue ball caused the eight ball to careen to the corner. But strictly speaking, I’m wrong. Spacetime is simply a species-specific desktop, and physical objects are icons on the desktop; or, as we have just been discussing, spacetime is a communications channel and physical objects are messages about fitness. If I drag an icon to the trashcan and its file gets deleted, it’s often helpful, though mistaken, for me to think that the movement of the icon to the trashcan literally caused the file to be deleted. 

Indeed, the ability to predict the consequences of one’s actions through this kind of pseudo, cause-effect reasoning is a sign of a well-designed interface.

This prediction of ITP—that the appearance of causal interactions between physical objects in spacetime is a fiction—has interesting support from quantum computations that lack causal order. 17 Normally we compute one step at a time, in a specific causal order. I might, for instance, start with the number ten, divide it by two, and then add two, to get the result seven. If I reverse the order, if I add two and then divide by two, I get the result six. The order of operations matters. But computers have now been built in which there is no definite causal order of operations. Instead the computer uses a superposition of causal orders, resulting in more efficient computation. 18

The interface theory predicts that physical causality is a fiction. This is not contradicted by physics. If, as physicists now say, spacetime is doomed, then so also are its physical objects and their apparent causality. So are current theories of consciousness, such as the integrated information theory (IIT) of Giulio Tononi or the biological naturalism of John Searle, that identify consciousness with certain causal properties of physical systems in spacetime. 19 If physical objects such as neurons have no causal powers, then IIT identifies consciousness with a fiction—not a promising move. Moreover, causal computations are less powerful than computations that abandon causality. 20 When IIT identifies consciousness with causal computations, it identifies consciousness with inferior computations. Why should consciousness be inferior? What principled insight about consciousness dictates this dubious claim?

The fictive nature of physical causality makes it tricky to construct the elusive “theory of everything.” We must first postulate a theory of our interface, and of its various levels of data compression and error correction. Then we can use this theory to ask what, if anything, we can infer about objective reality from the structures we see in the interface. If we can’t infer anything, then we must postulate a theory of objective reality and predict how it appears in our interface. This is the normal scientific process of using our theories to make empirical predictions that can be tested by careful experiments. I suspect that, if we succeed in this enterprise, we will find that the distinction we make between the living and nonliving is an artifact of limitations of our spacetime interface, not an insight into the nature of reality. We will find a unified description for reality—animate and inanimate—once we take into account the limits of our interface. We will also find that networks of neurons are among our symbols for error-correcting coders.

In ITP we can visualize the link between perception and action in a simple diagram, shown in Figure 10 , in which an agent interacts with the world. The rounded box at the top of the diagram represents the world outside the agent. I won’t claim, for now, to know anything about this world. In particular, I won’t assume that it has space, time, or objects. I’ll simply say that this mysterious world has many states—whatever they may be—that can change. The agent, for its part, has a repertoire of experiences and actions, shown in rounded boxes. Based on its current experience, the agent decides whether, and how, to change its current choice of action. This decision is depicted by the arrow labeled “decide.” The agent then acts on the world, as depicted by the arrow labeled “act.” The action of the agent changes the state of the world. The world, in response, changes the experience of the agent, as depicted by the arrow labeled “perceive.” Perception and action are thus linked in a “perceive-decide-act” (PDA) loop (which is described mathematically in the appendix).

Fig. 10: The “perceive-decide-act” (PDA) loop. Natural selection shapes this loop so that experiences guide actions that enhance fitness. © DONALD HOFFMAN

The PDA loop is shaped by an essential feature of evolution—the fitness-payoff functions. The fitness of an action depends on the state of the world, but also on the organism (the agent) and its state. Each time an agent acts on the world, it changes the state of the world, and reaps a fitness reward (or punishment). Only an agent that acts in ways that reap enough fitness rewards will survive and reproduce. Natural selection favors agents with PDA loops properly tuned to fitness. For such an agent, its “perceive” arrow sends it messages about fitness, and its experiences represent these messages about fitness. The messages and experiences are all about fitness, not about the state of the world. The experiences of the agent become an interface—not perfect, but good enough. It guides actions that glean enough fitness points to survive long enough to rear offspring.

Each agent has been molded, through generations of ruthless selection, to decide on actions that lead to desirable payoffs in fitness. The reproductive imperative, that one must act in ways that collect enough fitness points to raise offspring, coerces the coordination of perception, decision, and action. Those who lack this coordination suffer a pathetic proclivity to die young. Those who possess this coordination enjoy perceptions that form a useful interface and actions that link properly to that interface.

Experiences and actions are not free. The larger your repertoire, the more calories you need, so there are selection pressures to keep these repertoires small. But if your repertoires are too small, you may lack essential data about fitness or critical actions that could enhance fitness. Different agents evolve different solutions, different ways to balance the competing forces of selection. 

Humans probably have a larger repertoire of experiences than beetles; bears have a larger repertoire of olfactory experiences than humans. There is no consummate solution—just workable schemes that let agents survive in available niches.

But in all solutions, the repertoire of experiences and actions is small compared to the complexity of the relevant fitness payoffs. All messages about fitness that an agent perceives must compress information about fitness into a manageable size and useful format, without losing critical information. And messages should allow an agent to find and correct errors.

For instance, you’re strolling along a sidewalk at dusk, and suddenly jump in fear. You peer around to find a culprit, and relax when you discern a garden hose in the grass. Your jump was triggered by a fitness message with inadequate error correction—it incorrectly said “snake.” Because this message didn’t waste time on error correction, it arrived quickly and you acted promptly to avoid a fitness-reducing bite. After your initial startle, an error-corrected message arrived saying, “No worries, just a hose.” Your needless jump wasted calories and triggered stress-inducing cortisol, so it slightly pared your fitness. But in the long run, such quick and fallible messages stoke your fitness by slashing the risk of a mortal bite. If you trafficked only in plodding but reliable messages, then you would hasten the day that you correctly learn, “You’ve just been bitten.” Correct, but less helpful.

This illustrates that there are multiple solutions to the problem of compressing and correcting fitness messages. We can expect that natural selection has shaped a variety of solutions tailored to the vagaries of fitness, and that a single organism may embody multiple solutions for its different fitness needs. But we can also expect to find similar solutions across species because evolution, in the process of speciation, will often repurpose rather than redesign. We see repurposing in the unintelligent design of our eyes: light that passes through the lens of the eye must negotiate a gauntlet of blood vessels and interneurons before it chances on a photoreceptor at the back of the retina. All vertebrates suffer this kludge, suggesting that it cropped up early in vertebrate evolution and was never corrected. The kludge isn’t necessary. Cephalopods, such as the octopus and squid, get things right—their photoreceptors sit in front of the interneurons and blood vessels.

We can see error correction in real time in the visual example shown in Figure 11 . On the left are two black disks with white cutouts. On the right these disks are rotated so that their cutouts align. Suddenly you see more than disks with cutouts. You see a glowing line that floats in front of the disks. You can check that you create the glow between the disks: cover the disks with your thumbs, and the glow disappears.

You can think of the glowing line as your correction of an erasure. It’s as though your visual system decides that the actual message that was sent was a straight line, but that part of the line got erased in transmission. It corrects the error by filling in the gap with a glowing line. This is similar to error correction in a simple “Hamming” code that can send only two messages: 000 or 111. 21 If the receiver gets, say, 101, then it knows that there was an error, that the middle 1 got erased, so it fixes the erasure and arrives at the message 111. This Hamming code uses three bits to send just one bit of information, so it allows the receiver to detect and correct one erasure error.
